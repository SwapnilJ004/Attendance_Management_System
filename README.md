# OOPSMiniProject
This is a mini project of Object Oriented Programming Systems(OOPS) for the topic Attendance Management System, build completely in JAVA.
It can calculate the percentage attendance of many students for many days with no boundaries. After the entry of the database, it asks the user to login as a teacher or a student with their name as Login Credential.
It then asks them, if they're a teacher, to get the percentage attendance of all the students, get daywise-attendance of all the students and check the eligibility of the studuents in exams.
User can also additionally create as many objects of the "Student" class as the total number of students' data you want to store in the database.

For preview purpose, I've made two objects of the student class in the code and have commented three more Student objects for reference.
The total lines of code for this program is 369.
